battle of verdun treaty of verdun the price of glory: verdun 1916 the price of glory; verdun 1916 for my part, i can say that the comradeship of arms, sealed on the battlefield of abbeville in may-june 1940, between the french armoured division, which i had the honour to command, and the gallant 51st scottish division under general fortune, played its part in the decision which i made to continue the fight at the side of the allies, to the end, come what may. base.morelaw.war.ceasefire_s base.morelaw.war.ceasefire_s base.morelaw.war.ceasefire_s base.morelaw.war.ceasefire_s base.morelaw.war.ceasefire_s
