in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). organization.leadership.person business.board_member.leader_of base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties
