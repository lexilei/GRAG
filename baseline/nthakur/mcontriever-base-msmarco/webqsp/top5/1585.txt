florence r. sabin fred c. newmeyer when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. he has nerve and he has knowledge. when a man goes through six years training to be a doctor he will never be the same. he knows too much. a doctor, like anyone else who has to deal with human beings, each of them unique, cannot be a scientist; he is either, like the surgeon, a craftsman, or, like the physician and the psychologist, an artist. this means that in order to be a good doctor a man must also have a good character, that is to say, whatever weaknesses and foibles he may have, he must love his fellow human beings in the concrete and desire their good before his own. base.biblioness.bibs_topic.is_really base.biblioness.bibs_topic.is_really base.biblioness.bibs_location.state base.locations.states_and_provences.continent base.locations.states_and_provences.continent
