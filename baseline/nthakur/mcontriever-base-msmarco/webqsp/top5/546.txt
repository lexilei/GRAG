thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics, and in 1908 he was knighted for his scientific achievements. bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity
