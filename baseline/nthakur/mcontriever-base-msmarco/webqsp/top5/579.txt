in that same year, wagner wrote his first opera, \"the fairies\", influenced by  the magic plays with music he had seen on a visit to vienna. while in zurich, wagner wrote the librettos for his opera cycle \"the ring of the nibelung\" influenced by his study of norse legends, german mythology and fairy tales. in \"tristan and isolde\", wagner allowed the music to dominate and express the emotions of the characters. wagner spent the rest of his life in bayreuth, with visits to london and italy for concerts. a warrant was issued for wagner's arrest and he left germany for zurich, missing the first performance of \"lohengrin\", which his friend, the composer liszt, conducted at weimar in 1850. music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer
