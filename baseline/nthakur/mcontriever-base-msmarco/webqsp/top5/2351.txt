during the early 1660s, hooke made important improvements to the compound microscope and in 1665, he published his great scientific work, 'micrographia' ('small drawings'). hooke was given the position of curator of experiments and from late 1662, his job was to provide each weekly meeting 'with three or four considerable experiments', and to test other experiments that might be suggested. in 1674, he met and befriended the experimental physicist hooke, who introduced him to flamsteed, the first astronomer royal. hooke was perhaps the greatest experimental scientist of the seventeenth century. at some point around 1671, he was inspired to take up microscopy, either through having seen a copy of hooke's popular illustrated book 'micrographia' (1665), or  through a desire to improve the glasses used generally by drapers to inspect the quality of cloth. astronomy.astronomical_observatory.discoveries astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discovery_site religion.place_of_worship_historical_use.religion religion.place_of_worship_historical_use.religion
