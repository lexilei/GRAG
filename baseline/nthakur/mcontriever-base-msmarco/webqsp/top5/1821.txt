in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. by november 1921, mainly through hitler's aggressive leadership, the party had 3,000 members. hitler left the army in 1920, and became party propagandist, editing the party newspaper the 'volkischer beobachter' ('people's observer'), arranging frequent meetings, changing the name of the party to the national-sozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei (the national socialist german workers' party, nsdap or nazi party), imposing himself as its chairman by july 1921, and giving the new party its symbol - the swastika - and its greeting, 'heil!'. government.political_party.politicians_in_this_party government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties
