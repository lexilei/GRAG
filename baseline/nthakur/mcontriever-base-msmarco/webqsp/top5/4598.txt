shakespeare's birthplace except for his marriage to ann hathaway when he was 18, little is known of shakespeare's early life until he was about 25, and his first play, \"henry vi\", was performed c. 1589-92. by the time these works were published in 1609, shakespeare was an acknowledged master of drama and an established country gentleman. eventually, shakespeare gained a financial stake in the theater and seems to have made a great deal of money with which he bought a large house in stratford-on- avon in 1597, and saw to it that a shakespeare crest was granted his father. as more theaters opened, more plays were needed, and shakespeare, recognized for his ability to write quickly, cleverly and copiously, was much in demand. fictional_universe.fictional_character.place_of_birth fictional_universe.fictional_character.place_of_birth theater.play.country_of_origin theater.play.country_of_origin theater.play.country_of_origin
