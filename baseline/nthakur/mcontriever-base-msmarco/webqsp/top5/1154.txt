chadwick james chadwick he deduced that each contained a positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons: only that kind of nucleus could repulse the positively charged alpha particles that happened to strike them and produce such enormous deflections. to demonstrate that the deflection was not caused merely by some surface effect, geiger and his associates also used metal reflectors of different thicknesses. geiger and rutherford also established the basic unit of electrical charge when it was involved in electrical activity, which was equivalent to that carried by a single hydrogen atom. common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for
