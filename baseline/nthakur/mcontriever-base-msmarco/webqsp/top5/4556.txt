discoveries and opinions of galileo early in 1611 galileo travelled to rome, where he spent several months demonstrating his discoveries,  and winning the approval of the jesuits of the roman college, the pope and several cardinals. inevitably, after a comparison of these two systems, galileo came down heavily on the side of copernicanism, and urban viii, feeling he had been tricked, summoned the old scientist to rome in february 1633. in july 1609, while visiting venice, galileo learned of the recent invention of the telescope by the dutch lens-grinder lippershey in 1608, and on his return to padua built one. in 1624 galileo returned to rome, to visit the new pope, urban viii, who had been a longtime friend (and to whom he had dedicated 'il saggiatore') and got permission to write about \"the systems of the world\", both of ptolemy and copernicus, as long as he discussed them noncommittally and came to the conclusion dictated to him in advance by the pope - i.e. that humans cannot presume to know how the world is really made,  because god could have brought about the same observable effects in ways unimagined by them. astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered
