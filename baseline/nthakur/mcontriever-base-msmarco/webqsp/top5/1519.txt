from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. with the failure of the british campaign, hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the soviet union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war. people.family.country people.family.country location.mailing_address.country organization.leadership.person military.military_combatant.military_commanders
