sarah dessen \"overall, my books represent a kind of shared communion and meditation with my fellow human beingsâ€¦ the books are also a part of what i call the great continuum of spiritual literary dialogue that i feel has been in progress since human beings first gave in to the urge to pray to their sense of something greater than themselves and interpreted certain signs or events or silences as responses to those prayers.\" children's book author very little in science fiction can transcend the gimmickry of a technical conceit, yet without that conceit at its heart a book is not truly science fiction. furthermore, so little emerging thought and technology is employed by sf writers today that the genre is lagging far behind reality both in the cosmology area and the technology area: sf is no longer a place to experiment, but is now very derivative. hodder children's books book.author.book_editions_published book.author.book_editions_published book.author.book_editions_published book.author.book_editions_published book.author.book_editions_published
