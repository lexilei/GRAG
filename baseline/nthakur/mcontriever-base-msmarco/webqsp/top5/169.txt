mozart was a genius. mozart and his father then  returned to salzburg  where mozart wrote eight symphonies, four divertimentos, and some songs and sacred music. from 1790-91 mozart worked on an opera based on a german fairytale \"die zauberflote\" (\"the magic flute\") which is thought by many to include some of his most moving music. in spite of his success mozart was in financial difficulties and performed a large number of subscription concerts to meet the bills. after performing in germany they made a long visit to paris where mozart's music (sonatas for keyboard and violin) was published for the first time, and where they were invited by louis xv to have supper at versailles. music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written
