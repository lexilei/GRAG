by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. then, in spite of a decline in the party's votes to 11 million in november 1932, hitler was helped to power by a deal with former chancellor papen, in which they secretly agreed to work together for a government in which hitler would be chancellor and papen's conservative supporters would hold important ministeries. in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. government.political_party.politicians_in_this_party government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties government.political_ideology.political_parties
