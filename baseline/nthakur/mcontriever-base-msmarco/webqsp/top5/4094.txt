some music, such as the piano and violin sonata k 454 written for a visiting violin virtuoso, was  so rapidly composed that mozart did not have time to write out the piano part and had to play from a piece of blank paper at the premiere. from 1790-91 mozart worked on an opera based on a german fairytale \"die zauberflote\" (\"the magic flute\") which is thought by many to include some of his most moving music. several of the great number of works mozart composed at this time show his growing maturity in technique and range, in particular his piano concerto k 271 and his five violin concertos. mozart then wrote several symphonies and his first true piano concerto (k 175 in d). when he was only four, mozart could play short pieces on the piano, and a year later he began composing. music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer
