columbus' career as a seaman began in 1476, when he sailed with a convoy of genoese ships from chios in the aegean for portugal, england and flanders. in 1478 or 1479, columbus married felipa moniz perestrello, a member of a prominent but impoverished portuguese family, with whom he soon afterwards settled on the island of porto santo, off madeira, where their only son, diego, was born in 1480. as a result, in the summer of 1485, columbus left portugal for spain, taking with him his five-year-old son, whom he placed in a franciscan friary at la rabida, near huelva. meanwhile, columbus had begun a long liaison with beatriz de enriques, who bore him a son, fernando, and had hispanicized his name, signing himself cristobal colon. origin theories of christopher columbus location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here
