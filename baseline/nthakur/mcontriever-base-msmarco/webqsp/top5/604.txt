during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts
