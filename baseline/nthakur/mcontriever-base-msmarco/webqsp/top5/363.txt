in 1913, einstein was made director of scientific research at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin and given a chair in physics  at the university of berlin, where he became the colleague of, among others, planck, nernst, and later schrodinger. he was studied by einstein. but it was einstein who achieved credit for explaining relativity in understandable terms. in 1910, he went to see einstein in zurich and they talked about the relevance of einstein's work in specific heats to his own experiments. einstein's hypothesis and accompanying mathematical formula, which has become known as einstein's photoelectric law, were confirmed by several experiments, laid the practical foundation for the fields of quantum physics and quantitative photoelectric chemistry, and got him the 1921 nobel prize in physics. chemistry.chemical_element.discoverer astronomy.asteroid.member_of_asteroid_group base.mathematics1.mathematician.theorems_with_his_her_name base.mathematics1.mathematician.theorems_with_his_her_name astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer
