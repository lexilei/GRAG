in the third book, ptolemy observed solstices and equinoxes which meant that he could predict the length of the seasons and design a model for the sun, showing it moving in a circular motion of uniform velocity. ptolemy lived and worked mainly in alexandria, egypt, where he set up an observatory on the top floor of a temple and made astronomical observations from around 125 to 150. up to this point, ptolemy based his work on ideas researched from his predecessors, but in the last five books of the 'almagest', he discussed his own planetary theory. most of the tables that ptolemy scattered throughout the 'almagest' were published under the title 'handy tables', which he updated when new data became available. he was the first to edit the latin works of the 2nd-century egyptian astronomer and geographer, ptolemy. at the library, ptolemy would have had available the entire accumulated wealth of information compiled by greek scholars over the previous four centuries. from arabic the work was translated into latin,  ptolemy's ideas soon reached western europe. he was doubtful about the validity of the ptolemy's  complex earth-centered astronomical system (on which all investigation of the heavens was based), and decided that there must be a simpler way of doing things. another of ptolemy's major works, the 'guide to geography', mapped out the known world, gave the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of major locations and showed how to construct maps using projective geometry which would eventually become the basis for the renaissance use of perspective . ptolemy researched works by other astronomers and scholars like hipparchus and aristarchos in order to create the ptolemaic system:  a geocentric scheme for the universe. doubts concerning ptolemy now that he had explained the motion of the sun and the moon, ptolemy went on to apply these motions to create a theory of eclipses, which he described in book six. edmond halley studied work of claudius ptolemy erasmus reinhold commented on work of claudius ptolemy georg von peuerbach dealt with work of claudius ptolemy 'wars of the lord' was divided into six books and revealed that ben gershom knew the astronomical work of the arab scientist al farghani it also demonstrated his rejection of  ptolemy, based on his own observations made between 1321-39, using his staff and camera obscura. from 1710, halley began to examine the writings of the second-century alexandrian astronomer, ptolemy , paying particular attention to his star catalog. ptolemy even as late as 1775, everybody also believed ptolemy's early claim that a southern continent bounded the indian ocean, until cook returned from the southern hemisphere having failed to find an antarctic continent. he read the only astronomical book available to him (by ptolemy, the ancient greek writer who believed in a geocentric universe) and he began to construct his own instruments for plotting and recording  the movements of the stars. kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation
