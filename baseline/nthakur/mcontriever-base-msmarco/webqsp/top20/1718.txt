president of brazil 1000px-presidential_standard_of_brazil.svg.png from now on, i think it is safe to predict, neither the democratic nor the republican party will ever nominate for president a candidate without good looks, stage presence, theatrical delivery, and a sense of timing. to be president of the united states, sir, is to act as advocate for a blind, venomous, and ungrateful client; still, one must make the best of the case, for the purposes of providence. in america, the president reigns for four years, and journalism governs for ever and ever. the president is the representative of the whole nation and he's the only lobbyist that all the one hundred and sixty million people in the country have. the president is the people's lobbyist. brazil when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president. now i'm beginning to believe it. i'm the only president you've got. in america, anybody can be president. that's one of the risks you take. under a presidential government, a nation has, except at the electing moment, no influence; it has not the ballot-box before it; its virtue is gone, and it must wait till its instant of despotism again returns. president of the united federation some of the presidents were great and some of them weren't. i can say that, because i wasn't one of the great presidents, but i had a good time trying to be one, i can tell you that. we want a president who is as much like an american tourist as possible. someone with the same goofy grin, the same innocent intentions, the same naive trust; a president with no conception of foreign policy and no discernible connection to the u.s. government, whose nice guyism will narrow the gap between the u.s. and us until nobody can tell the difference. luiz in√°cio lula da silva in our brief national history we have shot four of our presidents, worried five of them to death, impeached one and hounded another out of office. and when all else fails, we hold an election and assassinate their character. when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal. but there are advantages to being elected president. the day after i was elected, i had my high school grades classified top secret. no man will ever bring out of the presidency the reputation which carries him into it. government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.government_position_held.appointed_by government.government_position_held.appointed_by government.government_position_held.appointed_by government.government_position_held.appointed_by government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held government.politician.government_positions_held
