hitler tried first to secure rohm's support for his policies by persuasion and by giving him government office but failed to persuade him  and, with pressure from goering and himmler, in june 1934 he approved the so-called blood purge, when rohm and some 150 sa leaders were murdered, leaving hitler as undisputed dictator of the third reich. let's kill hitler the plot to kill hitler explaining hitler : the search for the origins of his evil explaining hitler: the search for the origins of his evil from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. on 29 july 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate hitler when colonel  von stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at hitler's field headquarters. at the end of 1942, german defeat at el-alamein and at stalingrad brought the turning point in the war, and hitler's character and way of life began to alter, his personal decline symbolized by his increasingly rare appearances and his self-enforced isolation in the 'wolf's lair' in the east prussian forests. as the red army approached berlin and the anglo-americans reached the elbe, on 19 march hitler ordered the destruction of what remained of german industry, communications and transport systems, and refused to allow his troops to surrender, effectively sentencing them to death. this widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove hitler to implement the 'final solution of the jewish question' which had been under consideration since 1939. with the failure of the british campaign, hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the soviet union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war. at last germany had to face the fact that it lacked the resources equal to a struggle against a world alliance which hitler himself had provoked. both the army and the judiciary passively accepted these murders, and at the beginning of august consented to the merging of the chancellorship and the presidency - with which went the supreme command of the armed forces of the reich - and all officers and ministers took an oath of allegiance to hitler personally. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. as a result, it was suggested that mackinder, through haushofer, had, unintentionally, it should be stressed, guided hitler. although the german army advanced fast into the soviet union, an unexpected counter attack in december 1941 made it clear that hitler's plan for of a single campaign were wrong. from these and other sources, the young hitler began to construct a vision of the world in which jews (by race, rather than by religion) became the symbol and cause of all chaos, corruption, and destruction in culture, politics and the economy, and that the press, prostitution, syphilis, capitalism, marxism, democracy and pacificism were all means exploited by 'the jew' in his conspiracy to undermine the german nation and the purity of the creative aryan race. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death people.deceased_person.cause_of_death
