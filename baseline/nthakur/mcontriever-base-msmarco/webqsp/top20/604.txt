during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. by november 1923 hitler was convinced that the weimar republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the bavarian government in munich. in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. during this vienna period (1907-13), hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, lanz von liebenfels (whose theory of \"theozoology\" divided humanity into two groups - aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the austrian pan-german leader, georg von schoenerer. from these hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his socialist and communist opponents. however, the depression of 1929 enhanced the appeal for the nazis, and hitler found support among wealthy industrialists keen to finance a strong right-wing, anti-democratic government, which at last placed the party on a secure financial footing. this widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove hitler to implement the 'final solution of the jewish question' which had been under consideration since 1939. at the same time, hitler gathered around him several of nazi leaders who later became infamous,  including rudolf hess (who introduced him to haushofer's expansionist theory of \"lebensraum\"). as a result, it was suggested that mackinder, through haushofer, had, unintentionally, it should be stressed, guided hitler. then, in spite of a decline in the party's votes to 11 million in november 1932, hitler was helped to power by a deal with former chancellor papen, in which they secretly agreed to work together for a government in which hitler would be chancellor and papen's conservative supporters would hold important ministeries. the nazi party adopted the ideas hitler had acquired in vienna - violent racial nationalism, anti-semitism and opposition to liberal democracy, combined with perverted versions of the philosophies of such german thinkers as haeckel and nietzsche - combined with a hatred of the post-war republican german government and 'socialistic' ideas of profit-sharing and nationalization. from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. with the backing of the press tycoon, alfred hugenberg, in 1929-30 hitler got nationwide exposure and in the 1930 elections, after an intensive series of rallies, the nazi vote jumped dramatically from 810,000 to 6,409,000 (18.3 per cent of the total vote), and the party won 107 seats in the reichstag, becoming the second largest party in the country. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. hitler tried first to secure rohm's support for his policies by persuasion and by giving him government office but failed to persuade him  and, with pressure from goering and himmler, in june 1934 he approved the so-called blood purge, when rohm and some 150 sa leaders were murdered, leaving hitler as undisputed dictator of the third reich. himmler's first contact with the nazi party (established in 1920, with hitler as chairman by july, 1921) was in 1923, when he joined the paramilitary, nationalist reichskriegsflagge under captain ernst rohm. military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts
