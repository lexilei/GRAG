he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. this was confirmed during 1898 when thomson extended his research to other phenomena caused by electrical discharges, and proved that particles with the same value e/m were released from a negatively charged hot wire and from a negatively charged zinc plate illuminated by ultraviolet light. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. in 1897 thomson found that cathode rays were deflected by electric fields, strong evidence that cathode rays were rapidly-moving charged particles. bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. he was succeeded by j. j. thomson as cavendish professor of experimental physics at cambridge in 1884. thomson was then for several years largely occupied in building a comprehensive explanation of the conduction of electricity through gases, and in particular of the phenomenon of cathode rays - a subject that had become extremely popular among physicists during the preceding decade, largely as a result of the work of plucker , hittorf , crookes , goldstein and others. over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. rutherford became the first research student to work under english physicist j.j. thomson at the cavendish laboratory. he speculated that these particles had a mass over 1,000 times smaller than hydrogen (today it is known that the correct ratio is closer to 1,800:1), and that particles with this small mass were universal constituents of matter, since they were the same whatever the chemical nature of the gas carrying the discharge and the electrodes through which it entered and left. analyzing the properties that might be expected, thomson showed that the sphere would have apparent added mass due to the charge and proportional to the electrostatic energy. between 1906 and 1914 thomson entered his second and last great period of research, which he devoted to the study of \"canal rays\", streams of positively charged ions (first discovered by eugen goldstein), which thomson named \"positive rays.\" using magnetic and electric fields to deflect these rays, in 1912 he found that ions of neon gas are deflected by different amounts, indicating that they consist of a mixture of ions with different charge-to-mass ratios. thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics, and in 1908 he was knighted for his scientific achievements. thomson then developed experiments in which the rays were deflected by both magnetic and electrical fields. soon thomson, working with rutherford , found that passing x-rays through gases greatly increased their ability to conduct electricity, as the x-rays ionized the gases (they converted gas atoms into ions, which carry an electrical charge and so are good carriers of current), and that the resulting conduction resembled in some ways the conduction by ions during electrolysis of a solution. thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons. in early 1896 thomson asked rutherford to help him study the effects of roentgen's x-rays on the discharge of electricity in gases. joseph john thomson he already suspected that clouds were produced in dust-free air by the condensation of water droplets on ions (charged atoms or molecules) in the air (forming condensation nuclei), and wanted to test this idea by seeing whether the additional ions formed by the radiation from x-rays might bring about more intensive cloud formations. this work was later continued by one of thomson's students, francis aston (developer of the mass spectrograph), and others, and lead to the discovery of many other isotopes, vital to the understanding of the heavy radioactive elements, such as uranium and radium. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object fictional_universe.fictional_setting.fictional_characters_born_here fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation
