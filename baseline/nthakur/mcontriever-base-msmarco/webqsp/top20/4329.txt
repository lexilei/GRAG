this was followed in 1498 by the death of her daughter isabella, queen of portugal, when giving birth to her only son, miguel. isabella of aragon, queen of portugal the last decade of isabella's reign was, however, plagued by tragedy, as in 1497 she lost her only son and heir, juan. isabella of castile was one of the most influential monarchs of the 15th century, who during her eventful joint reign with ferdinand of aragon brought about the permanent union of spain. do√±a isabel de castilla i, queen isabella i isabella of portugal, queen of castile from 1479, isabella of castile and her husband ferdinand of aragon attempted to strengthen their hold over their dual kingdom by reducing the power of the castilian and aragonese nobles. during 1503, isabella, already stressed by the condition of juana, became herself very ill, possibly with either cancer (a tumour having been reported) or heart disease, and died. official portrait of isabella, attributed to juan de flandes, c. 1485 isabella of castile her inquisitor was tomas de torquemada during the 1490s, isabella, with the aid of her spiritual advisers - such as hernando de talavera, (archbishop of granada from 1492), and cardinal cisneros (archbishop of toledo from 1495) - was also preoccupied with the eradication of corruption from and strict reformation of the spanish monasteries. holy roman emperor maximilian i in-law was isabella of castile he strengthened his alliance with spain by marrying son his philip to the daughter of ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella of castile. but columbus' four voyages also brought isabella fresh problems, not least that of the newly discovered \"indians\". in 1478 they received permission from pope sixtus iv for the establishment of a spanish inquisition to deal with the supposedly evil influence of the jews and marranos, and by the early 1480s, under the leadership of the dominican cleric torquemada (who had been isabella's confessor and religious adviser since her childhood), it would become the vehicle for the systematic persecution, confiscation of goods, and expulsion of spain's jewry (1492). isabella and ferdinand were united in their aim of ending the long process of 'reconquista', by taking over the last muslim stronghold in spain, the kingdom of granada. around the same time, isabella and ferdinand finally agreed to sponsor the italian seaman columbus on a voyage of exploration westwards into the atlantic. her eldest surviving daughter juana, wife of philip i and mother of the holy roman emperor charles v, became the heiress of castile, despite the fact that from 1501 she began to show alarming signs of mental imbalance that would later earn her the title of \"the mad\". isabella i of castile through perez's influence, in the spring of 1486 columbus was granted an audience with  king ferdinand and queen isabella of  spain to argue his case. royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.monarchs_from_this_line royalty.royal_line.kingdom_s_ruled
