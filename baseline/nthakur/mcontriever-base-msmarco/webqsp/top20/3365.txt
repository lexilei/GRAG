dickens's next novel, \"martin chuzzlewit\", the first to have a unified theme, was influenced by the poetry of tennyson and robert browning, but it was his first failure. in the early 1851, collins became involved in amateur theatricals and it was through this interest in the stage that he first met his lifelong friend charles dickens, 12 years his senior and already a hugely successful novelist. his first major success was \"pickwick papers\", published (as most of dickens's novels would be) in monthly instalments. from the mid-1850s, dickens wrote some of his best novels. dickens began his literary career at 21, writing \"sketches\" (generally about london) under the pen-name \"boz\". all four novels achieved huge success and dickens's literary reputation was made before he was 30. dickens returned to england briefly in 1846, did some editorial work but no major writing, tried his hand at amateur dramatic production,  then  moved back to the continent, settling in switzerland, where he wrote \"dombey and son\", generally considered his first mature masterpiece. charles dickens: a tale of ambition and genius henry james reviewed work of charles dickens laura dewey bridgeman written about by charles dickens dickens fortunes were now improving and he moved back to london, where he wrote \"the personal history of david copperfield,\" (1849-50), his own favorite. interestingly, after dickens left his publisher, chapman and hall, because they failed to secure him Â£1,000 for the december 1843 publication of a christmas carol, he signed on with bradbury and evans. but in england, it was coolly received, although the novelist dickens greatly admired tennyson's work and introduced him to the american poet longfellow. in 1842, after visiting the perkins institute,  dickens published an enthusiastic description of howe's work. for the opening story, dickens selected one by elizabeth gaskell, another novelist/social reformer and  friend. among the guests were: author trollope, novelist wilkie collins,  and famous writer dickens, who gave his last reading there in 1870, three months before his death. in april of 1858, dickens began a gruelling series of public readings. well received throughout the tour, dickens later wrote a book about his experiences. \"little dorrit,\"  drew on dickens's boyhood and marked a the start of more carefully structured novels, like \"bleak house\". his work influenced the writing of dickens. book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement
