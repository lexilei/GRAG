the cuban missile crisis in 1962 america's discovery of soviet missile bases on cuba precipitated the cuban missile crisis. cuban missile crisis reflections on the cuban missile crisis one hell of a gamble: khrushchev, castro, and kennedy, 1958-1964 - the secret history of the cuban missile crisis in 1962, the cuban crisis brought the u. s. and the u.s.s.r. close to war. the u.s. had found evidence of soviet missiles in cuba and confronted khrushchev, who, after a few tense days, agreed to remove the missiles from castro's cuba. the soviets, however, did not tell castro they had agreed to remove the missile bases and as a result, relations between cuba and the soviet union cooled, though, with the american embargo, cuba continued to be dependent on the soviets for trade and military and economic aid. in october, 1962, alarmed at news of a russian missile base in cuba, kennedy ordered a blockade of all imported offensive weapons. the collapse of communism in europe and the soviet union in the 1990s had a traumatic effect on cuba. soviet advisers bringing weapons and military equipment arrived in cuba in late 1960. the kennedy tapes: inside the white house during the cuban missile crisis the u.s. response to soviet military buildup in cuba; report to the people october 22, 1962 on oct. 22, kennedy banned the delivery of offensive weapons to cuba and authorized u.s. warships to search any approaching ships. in april, 1961, president kennedy authorized the invasion of cuba by exiled cubans, but when the invaders landed at the bay of pigs they were routed. in 1983, cuban troops fought the americans when the u.s. invaded grenada. the cuban economy stagnated in the 1980s, though castro retained his high profile and became increasingly involved with the third world. in april 1961, kennedy gave his blessing to the disastrous bay of pigs invasion of cuba by cuban exiles trained in the u.s. during eisenhower's presidency. the exodus was enormous, and cuba lost thousands of doctors, engineers, administrators and other professionals. when he took office, castro had already installed himself as the marxist leader of cuba and was forging close ties with the soviet union. military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved military.military_combatant.military_conflicts military.military_combatant.military_conflicts military.military_combatant.military_conflicts
