in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). this widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove hitler to implement the 'final solution of the jewish question' which had been under consideration since 1939. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. hitler, 1889-1936 : hubris hitler, 1889-1936: hubris during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. hitler left the army in 1920, and became party propagandist, editing the party newspaper the 'volkischer beobachter' ('people's observer'), arranging frequent meetings, changing the name of the party to the national-sozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei (the national socialist german workers' party, nsdap or nazi party), imposing himself as its chairman by july 1921, and giving the new party its symbol - the swastika - and its greeting, 'heil!'. hitler and his generals: military conferences 1942-1945 by november 1921, mainly through hitler's aggressive leadership, the party had 3,000 members. from these hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his socialist and communist opponents. during this vienna period (1907-13), hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, lanz von liebenfels (whose theory of \"theozoology\" divided humanity into two groups - aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the austrian pan-german leader, georg von schoenerer. himmler's first contact with the nazi party (established in 1920, with hitler as chairman by july, 1921) was in 1923, when he joined the paramilitary, nationalist reichskriegsflagge under captain ernst rohm. at the same time, hitler gathered around him several of nazi leaders who later became infamous,  including rudolf hess (who introduced him to haushofer's expansionist theory of \"lebensraum\"). the mind of adolf hitler during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. organization.leadership.person business.board_member.leader_of base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties organization.organization.leadership organization.organization.leadership organization.organization.leadership organization.organization.leadership organization.organization.leadership
