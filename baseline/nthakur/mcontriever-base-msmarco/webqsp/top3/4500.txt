gutenberg changed history with his typeface and printing press. using paper he had made from cloth rags and vellum sheets, gutenberg set about printing his bible, which may have begun as early as 1450 (but more probably in 1452). the evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three strasbourg men - hans riffe, andres heilmann and andres dritzehen - which indicates that by this date gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans. law.inventor.inventions law.invention.inventor base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas
