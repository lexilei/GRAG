it is a dogma of the roman church that the existence of god can be proved by natural reason. now this dogma would make it impossible for me to be a roman catholic. if i thought of god as another being like myself, outside myself, only infinitely more powerful, then i would regard it as my duty to defy him. catholicism is not a soothing religion. it's a painful religion. we're all gluttons for punishment. the thing with catholicism, the same as all religions, is that it teaches what should be, which seems rather incorrect. this is what should be. now, if you're taught to live up to a what should be that never existed -- only an occult superstition, no proof of this should be -- then you can sit on a jury and indict easily, you can cast the first stone, you can burn adolf eichmann, like that! religion.religion.collective_term_for_adherents religion.religion.deities religion.religion.deities
