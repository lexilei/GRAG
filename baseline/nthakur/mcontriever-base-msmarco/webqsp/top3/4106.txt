in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. organization.leadership.person business.board_member.leader_of base.activism.activism_issue.supporting_political_parties
