he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. this was confirmed during 1898 when thomson extended his research to other phenomena caused by electrical discharges, and proved that particles with the same value e/m were released from a negatively charged hot wire and from a negatively charged zinc plate illuminated by ultraviolet light. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction
