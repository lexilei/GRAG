dickens's next novel, \"martin chuzzlewit\", the first to have a unified theme, was influenced by the poetry of tennyson and robert browning, but it was his first failure. in the early 1851, collins became involved in amateur theatricals and it was through this interest in the stage that he first met his lifelong friend charles dickens, 12 years his senior and already a hugely successful novelist. his first major success was \"pickwick papers\", published (as most of dickens's novels would be) in monthly instalments. book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement
