jesus was a brilliant jewish stand-up comedian, a phenomenal improviser. his parables are great one-liners. i thank god for the honesty and virility of jesus religion which makes us face the facts and calls us to take a man's part in the real battle of life. jesus is the god whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair. people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived
