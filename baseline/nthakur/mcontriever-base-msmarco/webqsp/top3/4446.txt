in the third book, ptolemy observed solstices and equinoxes which meant that he could predict the length of the seasons and design a model for the sun, showing it moving in a circular motion of uniform velocity. ptolemy lived and worked mainly in alexandria, egypt, where he set up an observatory on the top floor of a temple and made astronomical observations from around 125 to 150. up to this point, ptolemy based his work on ideas researched from his predecessors, but in the last five books of the 'almagest', he discussed his own planetary theory. kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by
