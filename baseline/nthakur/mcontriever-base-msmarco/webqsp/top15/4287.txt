niels bohr and the development of physics bohr began to develop a model of the atom in which electrons were disposed in rings around the nucleus -- a first step towards an explanation of atomic structure. during the 1920s and 1930s, bohr wrote extensively about atomic structures, proposing two concepts that he considered fundamental to the \"new physics\". niels henrik david bohr his work developed by george gamow to confront this problem, bohr began with the question of atomic spectra. niels henrik david bohr his work developed by werner karl heisenberg albert einstein knew niels henrik david bohr niels henrik david bohr opposed by albert einstein they argued that it was completely at odds with classical physics, and bohr's use of a classical model to explain the structure and behavior of the nucleus, made the theory even more illogical. niels henrik david bohr the most famous and most outspoken anti-bohr, however, was german/american physicist einstein, who never accepted bohr's claim that quantum mechanics was the \"rational generalization of classical physics\", necessary for the understanding of atomic phenomena. bohr had used the quantum concept of german physicist planck to explain the spectral lines of atoms in terms of the energy differences of electron orbits at various quantum states. at bohr's lectures pauli began to consider some of the fundamental problems involved in bohr's quantum theory of the atom (such as the existence of various electron energy levels within an atom) and decided that classical physics could not explain why electrons were distributed in various energy levels outside the nucleus, each energy level containing a set number of electrons. during the 30s, bohr turned to a new, but related, topic: the composition of the atomic nucleus. bohr came up with a possible solution to the problem: he hypothesized that certain orbits existed within an atom in which an electron could travel without radiating energy. chemistry.chemical_element.atomic_mass chemistry.chemical_element.discovering_country chemistry.chemical_element.periodic_table_block chemistry.chemical_element.periodic_table_block chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes
