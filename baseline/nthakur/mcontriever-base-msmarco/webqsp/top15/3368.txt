death of adolf hitler hitler, 1889-1936: hubris hitler, 1889-1936 : hubris on 29 july 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate hitler when colonel  von stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at hitler's field headquarters. in may 1913, hitler left vienna for munich, germany in order to avoid military training in austria. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. after two idle years in linz, in october 1907 hitler left his mother (who was incurably ill with cancer) and moved to vienna, where he remained until 1913 leading a bohemian existence, making a precarious living selling paintings and drawings of vienna and producing posters and advertisements for small traders. however, he was released after only nine months, during which he dictated to hess his autobiography and personal testament 'mein kampf' ('my struggle'),  published in 1925 and which by 1939 had sold five million copies, making hitler a wealthy man. hitler attended a primary school in braunau for five years, and then moved with his family to linz, the capital of upper austria, on his father's retirement in 1897. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). this widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove hitler to implement the 'final solution of the jewish question' which had been under consideration since 1939. at the end of 1942, german defeat at el-alamein and at stalingrad brought the turning point in the war, and hitler's character and way of life began to alter, his personal decline symbolized by his increasingly rare appearances and his self-enforced isolation in the 'wolf's lair' in the east prussian forests. the speeches of adolf hitler, april 1922-august 1939 adolf hitler was born in 1889 at braunau am inn, austria, the son of a 52- year-old habsburg customs official, alois schickelgruber hitler, and his third wife, a young peasant girl named klara poelzl. people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death people.deceased_person.place_of_death
