stalin now turned his formidable energy and organizing powers towards the defense of his country. on his return to petrograd (st. petersburg) in 1917, stalin again edited \"pravda\" and in november, 1917, took a prominent role in the bolshevik overthrow of the moderate provisional government that had replaced the tsar. stalin distrusted hitler but saw an opportunity to extend russia's borders while hitler's troops were occupied in western europe. when the three leaders met for summit meetings at tehran, yalta, and potsdam, stalin successfully argued for a strong soviet presence in eastern europe. in 1937, when stalin ordered a purge of international communists, most of the leading members of the yugoslav communist party, including gorkic, were murdered. in january, 1953, stalin declared that a \"doctors' plot\" had been uncovered, and ordered the arrest of various kremlin physicians, most of them jewish, on the grounds that they had used medical methods to eliminate various soviet leaders. stalin set the stage for the cold war of the 1950's by treating western powers as the implacable enemies of the soviet union and imposing the marxist ideology with absolute control within the union. in 1913, stalin briefly edited the bolshevik paper \"pravda\" before being arrested and banished to siberia. stalin was a hands-on commander. in august, 1939, stalin entered an alliance with germany, giving hitler the confidence to send his forces into poland, the act that began the second world war. in 1934, stalin began a campaign of terror that resulted in the deaths of millions more people. this gained stalin much admiration abroad. meanwhile, russia remained at war and as morale worsened, lenin - supported by trotsky (now his second-in-command), stalin and molotov - developed a plan for the proletariat to seize power by means of an armed uprising. stalin discarded lenin's economic policy, which still retained elements of capitalism, and in 1928 introduced a succession of radical five-year plans to implement state-owned industrialization and agricultural production. vladimir ilyich lenin assisted by stalin military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts
