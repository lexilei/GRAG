in 1783,  at the age of 13, beethoven was  appointed continuo  player to the bonn opera. this period of beethoven's life was extremely productive, among many great works the opera 'fidelio', written for the winter season of 1805. however, beethoven respected clementi's music more than mozart's. in 1804 beethoven completed his third symphony, considered by many to be his finest work. the last quartet was finished in 1826 and beethoven spent that summer on the estate of his surviving brother, nicolaus johann. some weeks before a second concert the next april, he had a private interview with beethoven, the only documented meeting between the two. hoffmann was also an enthusiastic admirer of beethoven. in may of the same year, the young german composer beethoven called on him to ask for lessons. with the start of the long and relatively stable administration of  metternich, beethoven entered what can be considered the third period of his life, from 1814 to 1827. visited beethoven in baden in 1823. the ninth symphony was beethoven's last single major work. english music lovers, already very aware of beethoven's work because of the efforts of george thomson, his english agent and publisher, now began to actively promote beethoven in london society. he apparently hoped to set up a financially lucrative arrangement of some sort with beethoven, but he returned to italy disappointed. on his way home from london, haydn stopped in bonn and met beethoven, then aged twenty- two. at the turn of the century, beethoven's style changed direction, with his first realisation that he was becoming deaf. visual_art.art_period_movement.associated_artworks visual_art.artwork.period_or_movement base.catalog.music_catalog.cataloged_composer base.catalog.music_catalog.cataloged_composer base.catalog.music_catalog.cataloged_composer base.catalog.music_catalog.cataloged_composer base.catalog.music_catalog.cataloged_composer base.catalog.cataloged_composer.music_catalog base.catalog.cataloged_composer.music_catalog base.catalog.cataloged_composer.music_catalog base.catalog.cataloged_composer.music_catalog base.catalog.cataloged_composer.music_catalog base.catalog.music_catalog.music_catalog_creator base.catalog.music_catalog.music_catalog_creator base.catalog.music_catalog.music_catalog_creator
