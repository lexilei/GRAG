from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. although the german army advanced fast into the soviet union, an unexpected counter attack in december 1941 made it clear that hitler's plan for of a single campaign were wrong. with the failure of the british campaign, hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the soviet union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war. explaining hitler : the search for the origins of his evil explaining hitler: the search for the origins of his evil by november 1923 hitler was convinced that the weimar republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the bavarian government in munich. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. paul von hindenburg failed to control adolf hitler as a result, it was suggested that mackinder, through haushofer, had, unintentionally, it should be stressed, guided hitler. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. at last germany had to face the fact that it lacked the resources equal to a struggle against a world alliance which hitler himself had provoked. in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts
