irving langmuir at home (c. 1900) irving langmuir langmuir langmuirâ€“blodgett trough langmuir probe langmuir adsorption model he went there on the recommendation of planck, who was impressed by his work in electrochemistry and thought that nernst had the energy and talent to rebuild berlin's reputation in chemistry. in the 1920s, nernst didn't make any great contributions to the development of physics, but he studied the work of other scientists, such as schrodinger's theories on wave mechanics. in 1922, he invented a small instrument that was magnetically controlled and amplified,  and could replicate the sound of a grand piano. rosetta langmuir probe between 1905 and 1913, nernst, who had a great interest in the automobile, published investigations into the efficiency of the internal combustion engine. he became involved in new studies in radiation, quantum chemistry, radioactivity, and cosmic rays,  and he was always on the lookout for technical inventions and particularly interested in electronic music. in 1910, he went to see einstein in zurich and they talked about the relevance of einstein's work in specific heats to his own experiments. he then worked on explosives and the development of the trench mortar. after the war,  nernst explored the application of chemistry to industrial and experimental projects and worked in photochemistry, chemical kinetics and chemical astrophysics. common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_types common.topic.notable_types common.topic.notable_types common.topic.notable_types
