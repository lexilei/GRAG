douglas engelbart douglas engelbart in 2008 norman engelbart ballard engelbart gerda engelbart diana engelbart produced in 1931, the analyzer enjoyed tremendous success, first in electrical engineering, then in acoustics, atomic physics, geophysics, and quantum mechanics:  fields where progress had been slowed by difficult mathematical calculations. christina engelbart he turned his hand to developing mechanical analysis machines to help engineers in applied mathematics, and by 1931, he and his students at mit had developed the mechanical forerunner of the computer:  the differential analyzer. after 1935, with the help of the carnegie institution of washington and the rockefeller foundation, he built the larger, faster, more flexible machine (completely electrical, except for the integrators) known as the 'rockefeller differential analyser, and established mit's center of analysis. in 1916 he began a second career as a technical consultant to the newly-established american research and development corporation (amrad), which was seeking promising radio inventions. laser man: theodore h. maiman and his brilliant invention bush continued his research, and in 1945 cemented his reputation as one of the founding fathers of the computer age in his essay: \"as we may think\" in \"atlantic monthly\". bush was horrified by the security investigations of the 1950s  and in 1954, came to the defense of eminent nuclear scientist oppenheimer, who also had opposed developing a hydrogen bomb. under bush's guidance,  from 1942 to 1947 the osrd oversaw the development of microwave radars, antisubmarine devices, amphibious warfare, and the early stages of the atomic bomb. law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions law.invention.inventor base.argumentmaps.original_idea.innovator law.us_patent.inventor base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas law.inventor.us_patents base.argumentmaps.original_idea.discovered_during_event base.argumentmaps.discovery.original_idea base.nobelprizes.nobel_subject_area.nobel_awards base.nobelprizes.nobel_honor.subject_area organization.organization_founder.organizations_founded organization.organization_founder.organizations_founded organization.organization_founder.organizations_founded organization.organization_founder.organizations_founded
