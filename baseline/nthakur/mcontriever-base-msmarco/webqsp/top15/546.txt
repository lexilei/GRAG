thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics, and in 1908 he was knighted for his scientific achievements. bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons. thomson then developed experiments in which the rays were deflected by both magnetic and electrical fields. this was confirmed during 1898 when thomson extended his research to other phenomena caused by electrical discharges, and proved that particles with the same value e/m were released from a negatively charged hot wire and from a negatively charged zinc plate illuminated by ultraviolet light. thomson made the first public declaration of his revolutionary findings in an evening speech to the royal institution on 30 april 1897. in 1897 thomson found that cathode rays were deflected by electric fields, strong evidence that cathode rays were rapidly-moving charged particles. thomson was then for several years largely occupied in building a comprehensive explanation of the conduction of electricity through gases, and in particular of the phenomenon of cathode rays - a subject that had become extremely popular among physicists during the preceding decade, largely as a result of the work of plucker , hittorf , crookes , goldstein and others. between 1906 and 1914 thomson entered his second and last great period of research, which he devoted to the study of \"canal rays\", streams of positively charged ions (first discovered by eugen goldstein), which thomson named \"positive rays.\" using magnetic and electric fields to deflect these rays, in 1912 he found that ions of neon gas are deflected by different amounts, indicating that they consist of a mixture of ions with different charge-to-mass ratios. he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. he was appalled to discover that thomson had lost interest in the subject and failed to realize the importance of bohr's thesis. in early 1896 thomson asked rutherford to help him study the effects of roentgen's x-rays on the discharge of electricity in gases. he was succeeded by j. j. thomson as cavendish professor of experimental physics at cambridge in 1884. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.fictional_setting.fictional_characters_born_here religion.founding_figure.religion_founded medicine.disease_cause.diseases medicine.disease_cause.diseases fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation fictional_universe.character_occupation.characters_with_this_occupation
