from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. after the fall of france in june 1940, hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of great britain. on 29 april, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, hitler married his long-term mistress eva braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed admiral donitz as head of state and goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"above all, i charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international jewry.\" the following day, hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the reich chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, trevor-roper's^:  'the last days of hitler', 1947). by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. with the failure of the british campaign, hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the soviet union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war. during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. by november 1923 hitler was convinced that the weimar republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the bavarian government in munich. in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. although the german army advanced fast into the soviet union, an unexpected counter attack in december 1941 made it clear that hitler's plan for of a single campaign were wrong. with the backing of the press tycoon, alfred hugenberg, in 1929-30 hitler got nationwide exposure and in the 1930 elections, after an intensive series of rallies, the nazi vote jumped dramatically from 810,000 to 6,409,000 (18.3 per cent of the total vote), and the party won 107 seats in the reichstag, becoming the second largest party in the country. in the 1932 elections, just after becoming a german citizen, hitler opposed the aging hindenburg in the presidential election, taking  36.8 percent of the vote on the second ballot and depriving von hindenburg of the necessary absolute majority. hitler tried first to secure rohm's support for his policies by persuasion and by giving him government office but failed to persuade him  and, with pressure from goering and himmler, in june 1934 he approved the so-called blood purge, when rohm and some 150 sa leaders were murdered, leaving hitler as undisputed dictator of the third reich. at last germany had to face the fact that it lacked the resources equal to a struggle against a world alliance which hitler himself had provoked. people.family.country people.family.country location.mailing_address.country organization.leadership.person military.military_combatant.military_commanders military.military_combatant.military_commanders military.military_combatant.military_commanders government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees government.political_appointer.appointees base.biblioness.bibs_location.country base.biblioness.bibs_location.country base.biblioness.bibs_location.country
