abroad, mussolini was regarded as a benign dictator with almost superhuman power. after the 1924 elections, the fascists had a majority in the italian parliament and mussolini's power was confirmed. by 1943, with mussolini in poor health, his tight rein on the country began to loosen. benito mussolini italians who had suffered a divided country, years of strikes, economic crises, and political chaos heartily welcomed mussolini. when the allies invaded sicily in july, 1943, political opposition to mussolini came to a head. edvard benes political connection with benito amilcare andrea mussolini mussolini as revealed in his political speeches after working as a schoolmaster in italy in his late teens, mussolini went to switzerland where he gained the reputation of being a revolutionary and was imprisoned a number of times. on his return home, mussolini began to make speeches stressing the need for a strong, vigorous italian leader, who would make sweeping social changes. since italy had capitulated to the allies on september 3, mussolini set up a new fascist government, the salo republic, in northern italy. in 1945, as the allies routed the germans from italy, mussolini refused offers of a flight to safety in switzerland or spain and retreated to the valtellina in northern italy to try to make a last stand. the fascist militia marched on rome, king victor emmanuel iii capitulated, and on october 31, 1922, at 39, mussolini became the youngest ever prime minister of italy. under mussolini, order was restored, italy was united, and strikes stopped. all this changed  in october, 1935, when mussolini invaded abyssinia (ethiopia), encouraged by hitler, with whom he had now become fatally entangled, even though he disliked hitler and was contemptuous of many nazis. government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.politician government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party government.political_party_tenure.party
