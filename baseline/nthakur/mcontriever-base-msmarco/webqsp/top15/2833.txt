nick clegg nicholas p. clegg antonio clegg hugh clegg miguel clegg alberto clegg he was an embittered atheist (the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in god as personally dislike him). when i told the people of northern ireland that i was an atheist, a woman in the audience stood up and said,  yes, but is it the god of the catholics or the god of the protestants in whom you don't believe? forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place, (portentous sight!) the owlet atheism, sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon, drops his blue-fringed lids, and holds them close, and hooting at the glorious sun in heaven, cries out, where is it? an atheist is a man who watches a notre dame -- southern methodist university game and doesn't care who wins. it is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion. among the repulsions of atheism for me has been its drastic uninterestingness as an intellectual position. where was the ingenuity, the ambiguity, the humanity (in the harvard sense) of saying that the universe just happened to happen and that when we're dead we're dead? first, whenever a man talks loudly against religion, always suspect that it is not his reason, but his passions, which have got the better of his creed. a bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbors, and where they separate, depend upon it,  'tis for no other cause but quietness sake. university of cambridge objectivism: the philosophy of ayn rand education.field_of_study.students_majoring education.field_of_study.students_majoring education.education.major_field_of_study education.education.major_field_of_study education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates education.educational_institution.students_graduates
