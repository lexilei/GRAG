he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. this was confirmed during 1898 when thomson extended his research to other phenomena caused by electrical discharges, and proved that particles with the same value e/m were released from a negatively charged hot wire and from a negatively charged zinc plate illuminated by ultraviolet light. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. in 1897 thomson found that cathode rays were deflected by electric fields, strong evidence that cathode rays were rapidly-moving charged particles. bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. he was succeeded by j. j. thomson as cavendish professor of experimental physics at cambridge in 1884. thomson was then for several years largely occupied in building a comprehensive explanation of the conduction of electricity through gases, and in particular of the phenomenon of cathode rays - a subject that had become extremely popular among physicists during the preceding decade, largely as a result of the work of plucker , hittorf , crookes , goldstein and others. over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. rutherford became the first research student to work under english physicist j.j. thomson at the cavendish laboratory. he speculated that these particles had a mass over 1,000 times smaller than hydrogen (today it is known that the correct ratio is closer to 1,800:1), and that particles with this small mass were universal constituents of matter, since they were the same whatever the chemical nature of the gas carrying the discharge and the electrodes through which it entered and left. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature
