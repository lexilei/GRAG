how obama won the west auma obama obama, the tea party, and the art of political persuasions part 1 “with intent to neither idolize nor demonize the man [barack obama], it seems fair and evident enough to say that the current president of america is not a leader whose way is that of violent public outbursts. it appears to be more that of a warrior-philosopher who practices the art of political persuasion by authoring acclaimed books, delivering well-crafted speeches, assembling unified coalitions, passing historic legislation, signing well-aimed executive orders, and cultivating a poised but accessible demeanor.” obama, the tea party, and the art of political persuasions part 2 barack obama: people's president “the power of this poet-likely-to-become president first won the world’s attention at the democratic convention in 2004. even that event could have been described as “improbable” but it stands now as a fact of recorded history. between that history-making speech and presidential candidate obama’s bestselling books, dreams from my father and the audacity of hope, two things become clear about the power of eloquence. it is not simply melodious syllables or beautiful fury disguised as poetic art. in the hands and heart of a sincere individual seeking to serve the common good, it can represent truth, vision, and clarity empowered by strength, destiny, and intelligence.” --from the rise of the poet most likely to become president the obama nation : leftist politics and the cult of personality barack obama academy president barack obama: the man and his journey base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position base.obamabase.cabinet_member.cabinet_position
