in 1913, einstein was made director of scientific research at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin and given a chair in physics  at the university of berlin, where he became the colleague of, among others, planck, nernst, and later schrodinger. he was studied by einstein. but it was einstein who achieved credit for explaining relativity in understandable terms. in 1910, he went to see einstein in zurich and they talked about the relevance of einstein's work in specific heats to his own experiments. einstein's hypothesis and accompanying mathematical formula, which has become known as einstein's photoelectric law, were confirmed by several experiments, laid the practical foundation for the fields of quantum physics and quantitative photoelectric chemistry, and got him the 1921 nobel prize in physics. instead, much to the dismay of the majority of his fellow scientists (in particular his close friend the german quantum theorist born), einstein devoted the remaining years of his life to the search for a unified field theory, a single mathematical theory that would encompass all physical fields, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism. einstein : his life and universe einstein: his life and universe einstein began his work on relativity by making two assumptions. the equations he provided to explain the forces in this field provided the basis for einstein's theory of relativity. chemistry.chemical_element.discoverer astronomy.asteroid.member_of_asteroid_group base.mathematics1.mathematician.theorems_with_his_her_name base.mathematics1.mathematician.theorems_with_his_her_name astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer chemistry.chemical_element.atomic_mass law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions astronomy.astronomical_observatory.discoveries chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes
