franz liszt: the man and his music liszt was the greatest piano virtuoso of his time, a composer of enormous originality, and a principal figure in the romantic movement. liszt now had ample time to compose, as well as conduct the court orchestra for the next 12 years, a period of remarkable productivity. in his last years, liszt's music became starker, more introverted, and more experimental. liszt compared this work to beethoven's music. in 1822, liszt's family moved to vienna, where liszt studied the  piano with austrian pianist and composer czerny, and composition with  italian composer and conductor salieri, musical director of the viennese court. in 1823, now a famous child prodigy, liszt moved with his  family to paris, giving concerts in munich, stuttgart and other german towns. for the next eight years liszt lived mainly in rome and occupied himself more and more with religious music. in 1835, at 24, liszt took a teaching post at the newly founded geneva conservatory and wrote a manual of piano technique (now lost). in 1869, liszt was invited to return to weimar by the grand duke to give master classes in piano. music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer
