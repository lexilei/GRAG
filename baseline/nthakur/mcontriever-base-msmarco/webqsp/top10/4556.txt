discoveries and opinions of galileo early in 1611 galileo travelled to rome, where he spent several months demonstrating his discoveries,  and winning the approval of the jesuits of the roman college, the pope and several cardinals. inevitably, after a comparison of these two systems, galileo came down heavily on the side of copernicanism, and urban viii, feeling he had been tricked, summoned the old scientist to rome in february 1633. in july 1609, while visiting venice, galileo learned of the recent invention of the telescope by the dutch lens-grinder lippershey in 1608, and on his return to padua built one. in 1624 galileo returned to rome, to visit the new pope, urban viii, who had been a longtime friend (and to whom he had dedicated 'il saggiatore') and got permission to write about \"the systems of the world\", both of ptolemy and copernicus, as long as he discussed them noncommittally and came to the conclusion dictated to him in advance by the pope - i.e. that humans cannot presume to know how the world is really made,  because god could have brought about the same observable effects in ways unimagined by them. in pisa, galileo began a controversial campaign to discredit accepted aristotelian physics. discoveries and opinions of galileo: including the starry messenger (1610), letter to the grand duchess christina (1615), and excerpts from letters on sunspots (1613), the assayer (1623) the 'letters' also confirmed galileo's earlier criticism of aristotelian cosmology, as he maintained that the movement of the spots across the face of the sun proved that copernicus' system was correct,  and also that the sun rotated. in his defence, galileo wrote two letters for publication, one to his pupil castelli and the other to the dowager duchess christina (both 1615), in which he argued that neither the bible nor nature could speak falsely and that whereas the investigation of nature was the province of the scientist, the reconciliation of scientific facts with the language of the bible was that of the theologian. galileo's method for checking the curvature of his lenses made it possible to use the telescope for astronomical observation. astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer
