the achievement of galileo from 1585 to 1589 galileo gave lessons in mathematics in florence and siena, and in 1586 he published an essay (describing his invention of a hydrostatic balance) which made him known throughout italy, and won him the support of a wealthy patron, the marchese del monte, for whom he wrote a treatise on the centre of gravity in solids (1588) and who got him the job of lecturer in mathematics at the university of pisa. early in 1611 galileo travelled to rome, where he spent several months demonstrating his discoveries,  and winning the approval of the jesuits of the roman college, the pope and several cardinals. viviani revered galileo and after his death in 1642  he hoped to edit and publish an account of his life and works and to develop the new ideas about mathematics galileo's work had stimulated. the private life of galileo once he was totally blind (1638), galileo was permitted to have his two friends, the geometrician viviani and torricelli, to live with him, to whom he was dictating his latest ideas on the theory of impact when he was seized with the slow fever that resulted in his death. on his return, galileo turned again to physics, and published a book on the behaviour of bodies placed in water: 'discourses on things that float' (1612). in pisa, galileo began a controversial campaign to discredit accepted aristotelian physics. discoveries and opinions of galileo inevitably, after a comparison of these two systems, galileo came down heavily on the side of copernicanism, and urban viii, feeling he had been tricked, summoned the old scientist to rome in february 1633. common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for
