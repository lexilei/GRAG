art smith lillian smith oprah's chef art smith signs on with tlc leisha kelly – author- \"house on malcolm street\" \"an author accepting language’s invitation to dance steps onto the floor of his her sensibility-charged consciousness and begins to move instinctively––even if with much dread––in ways that synchronize images, ideas, emotions, sounds, smells, ignorance, and knowledge.\" “sociologically, politically, psychologically, spiritually, it was never enough for him [james baldwin] to categorize himself as one thing or the other: not just black, not just sexual, not just american, nor even just as a world-class literary artist. he embraced the whole of life the way the sun’s gravitational passion embraces everything from the smallest wandering comet to the largest looming planet. he both confronted and cultivated creative vision with a drive, passion, and brilliance that few have matched, and simply being able to watch his genius sparkle from one sentence to the next could generate both awe and revelation.” \"overall, my books represent a kind of shared communion and meditation with my fellow human beings… the books are also a part of what i call the great continuum of spiritual literary dialogue that i feel has been in progress since human beings first gave in to the urge to pray to their sense of something greater than themselves and interpreted certain signs or events or silences as responses to those prayers.\" \"it’s a good thing that he [john galsworthy] and those who answered his call in the twentieth century have given the rest of us tilling fields in the twenty-first century a 90-year head start.\" contemporary authors: a bio-bibliographical guide to current writers in fiction, general nonfiction, poetry, journalism, drama, motion pictures, television. vol. 249 m.0b487zh location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.location.people_born_here location.hud_county_place.place location.hud_county_place.place location.hud_foreclosure_area.total_residential_addresses location.hud_county_place.county
