hitler tried first to secure rohm's support for his policies by persuasion and by giving him government office but failed to persuade him  and, with pressure from goering and himmler, in june 1934 he approved the so-called blood purge, when rohm and some 150 sa leaders were murdered, leaving hitler as undisputed dictator of the third reich. let's kill hitler the plot to kill hitler explaining hitler : the search for the origins of his evil explaining hitler: the search for the origins of his evil from the first, hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly general ludwig beck, chief of the general staff) that germany was not strong enough to defeat the allied powers. on 29 july 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate hitler when colonel  von stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at hitler's field headquarters. at the end of 1942, german defeat at el-alamein and at stalingrad brought the turning point in the war, and hitler's character and way of life began to alter, his personal decline symbolized by his increasingly rare appearances and his self-enforced isolation in the 'wolf's lair' in the east prussian forests. as the red army approached berlin and the anglo-americans reached the elbe, on 19 march hitler ordered the destruction of what remained of german industry, communications and transport systems, and refused to allow his troops to surrender, effectively sentencing them to death. this widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove hitler to implement the 'final solution of the jewish question' which had been under consideration since 1939. base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed base.disaster2.death_causing_event.person_killed people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death
