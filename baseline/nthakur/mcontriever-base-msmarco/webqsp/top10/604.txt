during the years 1930-33 hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'landbund', or league of land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the weimar republic. on leaving hospital, hitler returned to munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist german workers' party (dap), which hitler joined in september 1919. by july 1933, hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the communists, social democrats and jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps. on his release, hitler began to rebuild the nazi party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of goering, hess and goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival nazi leader, gregor strasser. during the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in germany, and helped (along with goebbels' propaganda) germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of german life, enforced by himmler's secret state police (gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and jews, who were systematically persecuted. by november 1923 hitler was convinced that the weimar republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the bavarian government in munich. in june 1934, hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the sa and its leader, captain ernst rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms. during this vienna period (1907-13), hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, lanz von liebenfels (whose theory of \"theozoology\" divided humanity into two groups - aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the austrian pan-german leader, georg von schoenerer. from these hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his socialist and communist opponents. however, the depression of 1929 enhanced the appeal for the nazis, and hitler found support among wealthy industrialists keen to finance a strong right-wing, anti-democratic government, which at last placed the party on a secure financial footing. military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts
