between 1665 and 1667, newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before leibniz's  discoveries. by their application, newton formulated the universal laws of nature with which he was able to solve virtually all the unsolved problems of his day. he knew newton. during his third year at cambridge, newton went beyond the compulsory study of aristotle and read the works of descartes , gassendi , hobbes , and 17th-century chemist boyle . he was convinced it was because of their personal liberty that the english, notably newton (whose funeral he attended in westminster abbey in 1727) and locke, were in the forefront of scientific thought, and was equally impressed by the works of shakespeare, milton and dryden. in 1669, barrow decided the world must know about newton's mathematical achievements and sent newton's preliminary work, \"on analysis by infinite series,\"  to john collins in london. it was acknowledged that though leibniz's discoveries were later in time, he preceded newton in publishing a full account. also at this time, newton began to think about gravity. a royal society panel, including halley and mathematician william jones ,  decided that newton was the first to unify and make explicit what had been latent in the work of various forerunners. an address on the genius and discoveries of sir isaac newton law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer law.invention.inventor law.invention.inventor astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discovery_site base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas
