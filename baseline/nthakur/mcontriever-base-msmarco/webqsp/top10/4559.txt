jesus was a brilliant jewish stand-up comedian, a phenomenal improviser. his parables are great one-liners. i thank god for the honesty and virility of jesus religion which makes us face the facts and calls us to take a man's part in the real battle of life. jesus is the god whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair. no man ever loved like jesus. he taught the blind to see and the dumb to speak. he died on the cross to save us. he bore our sins. and now god says, because he did, i can forgive you. the challenge of jesus: rediscovering who jesus was and is jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. it's them twisting it that ruins it for me. \t \"holding forth the word of life\" (logom z≈çes epechontes): philippians 2:16a and other references to paul's understanding of the involvement of early christian communities in spreading the gospel jesus through the centuries : his place in the history of culture jesus through the centuries: his place in the history of culture you should point to the whole man jesus and say, that is god. people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived people.person.places_lived
