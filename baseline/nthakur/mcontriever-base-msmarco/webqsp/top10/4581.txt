franz liszt: the man and his music liszt was the greatest piano virtuoso of his time, a composer of enormous originality, and a principal figure in the romantic movement. in 1823, now a famous child prodigy, liszt moved with his  family to paris, giving concerts in munich, stuttgart and other german towns. liszt now had ample time to compose, as well as conduct the court orchestra for the next 12 years, a period of remarkable productivity. in his last years, liszt's music became starker, more introverted, and more experimental. for the next eight years liszt lived mainly in rome and occupied himself more and more with religious music. in 1822, liszt's family moved to vienna, where liszt studied the  piano with austrian pianist and composer czerny, and composition with  italian composer and conductor salieri, musical director of the viennese court. liszt compared this work to beethoven's music. achille-claude debussy played for franz liszt franz liszt, vol. 1: the virtuoso years, 1811-1847 music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.composition.lyricist music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer music.composition.composer
