gutenberg changed history with his typeface and printing press. using paper he had made from cloth rags and vellum sheets, gutenberg set about printing his bible, which may have begun as early as 1450 (but more probably in 1452). the evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three strasbourg men - hans riffe, andres heilmann and andres dritzehen - which indicates that by this date gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans. the agreement with riffe and heilmann came to an end in 1443, by which time it is assumed (on the basis of the existence of a scrap of paper with eleven printed lines on each side, dated to 1442, which is the oldest example of european printing from moveable type) that gutenberg had had begun printing. this suggests that by 1438 gutenberg and dritzehen had in all probability already invented a printing process using moveable type (separate pieces of wood or metal for each letter of the alphabet). this work, now known as the gutenberg bible, is regarded as the first major book to come from a printing press. the partnership agreement ended in 1443, and by 1450 gutenberg was back in mainz borrowing money from goldsmith and financier johann fust to set up a new press, with the printing tools and equipment acting as security. he lost the suit, but the trial revealed that gutenberg was working on a new invention, and that some of the money advanced by dritzehen had been used to buy lead and other metals, a wooden press, and some printing materials. meanwhile, it appears that during the late 1450s gutenberg was able to establish a print-shop but all that is known for certain of gutenberg's last years is that in january 1465 he received a pension from the archbishop of mainz, as a distinguished citizen of mainz, and was given an annual measure of grain, wine, and clothing and exempted from certain taxes. aldus manutius used press of johannes gutenberg law.inventor.inventions law.invention.inventor base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas people.person.place_of_birth base.biblioness.bibs_location.country freebase.type_profile.published freebase.type_profile.published people.person.places_lived symbols.namesake.named_after symbols.namesake.named_after
