over the next twenty years copernicus developed his ideas, backing them up with mathematical calculations and diagrams. a more perfect heaven: how copernicus revolutionized the cosmos in copernicus's time, while some astronomers and philosophers even welcomed his theory as a long overdue alternative to the ptolemaic system, others were outraged at its revolutionary implications. copernicus revolutionized astronomy and his theory had a profound effect on philosophical and religious thought. on the academic grapevine he heard about the polish astronomer, copernicus, who had come up with a revolutionary new theory about a heliocentric universe. opposed publication of the theories of copernicus. in 1500, copernicus arrived in rome to give lessons in mechanics and mathematics and alexander gave him the job of professor of astronomy at the roman gymnasium. copernicus died in the same year his theories were published and is believed to have received a copy of \"de revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" on the last day of his life. in 1500 copernicus visited rome,  where he taught mathematics privately and made observations on a lunar eclipse which he used later for his lunar theory. in the 1543: \"on the revolutions of the celestial spheres\", copernicus put forward a view of the universe that provided a new basis for making the mathematical calculations needed to provide accurate information for calendar reform, to predict astronomical events like eclipses,  and to investigate the cosmos. law.inventor.inventions chemistry.chemical_element.discoverer chemistry.chemical_element.discoverer base.argumentmaps.original_idea.innovator base.argumentmaps.original_idea.innovator base.argumentmaps.original_idea.innovator base.argumentmaps.original_idea.innovator base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas
