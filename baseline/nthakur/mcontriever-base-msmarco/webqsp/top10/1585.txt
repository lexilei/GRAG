florence r. sabin fred c. newmeyer when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. he has nerve and he has knowledge. when a man goes through six years training to be a doctor he will never be the same. he knows too much. a doctor, like anyone else who has to deal with human beings, each of them unique, cannot be a scientist; he is either, like the surgeon, a craftsman, or, like the physician and the psychologist, an artist. this means that in order to be a good doctor a man must also have a good character, that is to say, whatever weaknesses and foibles he may have, he must love his fellow human beings in the concrete and desire their good before his own. for each illness that doctors cure with medicine, they provoke ten in healthy people by inoculating them with the virus that is a thousand times more powerful than any microbe: the idea that one is ill. the more ignorant, reckless and thoughtless a doctor is, the higher his reputation soars even amongst powerful princes. the doctor learns that if he gets ahead of the superstitions of his patients he is a ruined man; and the result is that he instinctively takes care not to get ahead of them. is it not also true that no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers or enjoins what is for the physician's interest, but that all seek the good of their patients? for we have agreed that a physician strictly so called, is a ruler of bodies, and not a maker of money, have we not? as long as men are liable to die and are desirous to live, a physician will be made fun of, but he will be well paid. base.biblioness.bibs_topic.is_really base.biblioness.bibs_topic.is_really base.biblioness.bibs_location.state base.locations.states_and_provences.continent base.locations.states_and_provences.continent base.locations.states_and_provences.continent people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death people.cause_of_death.parent_cause_of_death
