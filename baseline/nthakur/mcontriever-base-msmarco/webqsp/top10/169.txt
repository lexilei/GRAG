mozart was a genius. mozart and his father then  returned to salzburg  where mozart wrote eight symphonies, four divertimentos, and some songs and sacred music. from 1790-91 mozart worked on an opera based on a german fairytale \"die zauberflote\" (\"the magic flute\") which is thought by many to include some of his most moving music. in spite of his success mozart was in financial difficulties and performed a large number of subscription concerts to meet the bills. after performing in germany they made a long visit to paris where mozart's music (sonatas for keyboard and violin) was published for the first time, and where they were invited by louis xv to have supper at versailles. some music, such as the piano and violin sonata k 454 written for a visiting violin virtuoso, was  so rapidly composed that mozart did not have time to write out the piano part and had to play from a piece of blank paper at the premiere. mozart then wrote several symphonies and his first true piano concerto (k 175 in d). when he was only four, mozart could play short pieces on the piano, and a year later he began composing. over the following two and a half years, mozart and his sister played at all the most important centres for music in western europe. wrote opera about mozart and  salieri chaliapin sang his work his work was conducted by rachmaninov. music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written music.lyricist.lyrics_written
