thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics, and in 1908 he was knighted for his scientific achievements. bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons. thomson then developed experiments in which the rays were deflected by both magnetic and electrical fields. this was confirmed during 1898 when thomson extended his research to other phenomena caused by electrical discharges, and proved that particles with the same value e/m were released from a negatively charged hot wire and from a negatively charged zinc plate illuminated by ultraviolet light. thomson made the first public declaration of his revolutionary findings in an evening speech to the royal institution on 30 april 1897. in 1897 thomson found that cathode rays were deflected by electric fields, strong evidence that cathode rays were rapidly-moving charged particles. thomson was then for several years largely occupied in building a comprehensive explanation of the conduction of electricity through gases, and in particular of the phenomenon of cathode rays - a subject that had become extremely popular among physicists during the preceding decade, largely as a result of the work of plucker , hittorf , crookes , goldstein and others. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.person_in_fiction.representations_in_fiction fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.ethnicity_in_fiction.characters_of_this_ethnicity fictional_universe.fictional_setting.fictional_characters_born_here
