chadwick james chadwick he deduced that each contained a positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons: only that kind of nucleus could repulse the positively charged alpha particles that happened to strike them and produce such enormous deflections. to demonstrate that the deflection was not caused merely by some surface effect, geiger and his associates also used metal reflectors of different thicknesses. geiger and rutherford also established the basic unit of electrical charge when it was involved in electrical activity, which was equivalent to that carried by a single hydrogen atom. geiger's work with rutherford and another young physicist, ernest marsden, brought rutherford finally to the conclusion, in 1911, that the atoms contained a positively charged core or nucleus which repelled the alpha particles, the observed deflection of the alpha particles being due to the positively charged particle being repelled by the positively charged nuclei in the metal. in 1906 geiger accepted the post of assistant to arthur schuster, an expert on gas ionization and head of the physics department at the university of manchester. in 1906, he accepted the chair of professor of physics at manchester university in england, where he built up a renowned laboratory and a group of talented associates including geiger,  and physicist bohr. throughout the 30s, rutherford maintained close contact with leading world scientists, in particular,  physicists bohr,  planck, einstein and fermi. ernest rutherford corresponded with max planck common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for common.topic.notable_for
