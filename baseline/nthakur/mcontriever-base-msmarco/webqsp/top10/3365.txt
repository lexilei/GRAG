dickens's next novel, \"martin chuzzlewit\", the first to have a unified theme, was influenced by the poetry of tennyson and robert browning, but it was his first failure. in the early 1851, collins became involved in amateur theatricals and it was through this interest in the stage that he first met his lifelong friend charles dickens, 12 years his senior and already a hugely successful novelist. his first major success was \"pickwick papers\", published (as most of dickens's novels would be) in monthly instalments. from the mid-1850s, dickens wrote some of his best novels. dickens began his literary career at 21, writing \"sketches\" (generally about london) under the pen-name \"boz\". all four novels achieved huge success and dickens's literary reputation was made before he was 30. dickens returned to england briefly in 1846, did some editorial work but no major writing, tried his hand at amateur dramatic production,  then  moved back to the continent, settling in switzerland, where he wrote \"dombey and son\", generally considered his first mature masterpiece. charles dickens: a tale of ambition and genius henry james reviewed work of charles dickens laura dewey bridgeman written about by charles dickens book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement book.author.school_or_movement
