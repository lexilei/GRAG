niels bohr and the development of physics bohr began to develop a model of the atom in which electrons were disposed in rings around the nucleus -- a first step towards an explanation of atomic structure. during the 1920s and 1930s, bohr wrote extensively about atomic structures, proposing two concepts that he considered fundamental to the \"new physics\". niels henrik david bohr his work developed by george gamow to confront this problem, bohr began with the question of atomic spectra. niels henrik david bohr his work developed by werner karl heisenberg albert einstein knew niels henrik david bohr niels henrik david bohr opposed by albert einstein they argued that it was completely at odds with classical physics, and bohr's use of a classical model to explain the structure and behavior of the nucleus, made the theory even more illogical. niels henrik david bohr chemistry.chemical_element.atomic_mass chemistry.chemical_element.discovering_country chemistry.chemical_element.periodic_table_block chemistry.chemical_element.periodic_table_block chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes
