over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered fictional_universe.fictional_character.gender fictional_universe.fictional_character.gender
