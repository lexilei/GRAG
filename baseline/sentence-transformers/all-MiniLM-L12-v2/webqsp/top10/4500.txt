the evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three strasbourg men - hans riffe, andres heilmann and andres dritzehen - which indicates that by this date gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans. gutenberg changed history with his typeface and printing press. this suggests that by 1438 gutenberg and dritzehen had in all probability already invented a printing process using moveable type (separate pieces of wood or metal for each letter of the alphabet). this work, now known as the gutenberg bible, is regarded as the first major book to come from a printing press. the agreement with riffe and heilmann came to an end in 1443, by which time it is assumed (on the basis of the existence of a scrap of paper with eleven printed lines on each side, dated to 1442, which is the oldest example of european printing from moveable type) that gutenberg had had begun printing. using paper he had made from cloth rags and vellum sheets, gutenberg set about printing his bible, which may have begun as early as 1450 (but more probably in 1452). gutenberg printing press the partnership agreement ended in 1443, and by 1450 gutenberg was back in mainz borrowing money from goldsmith and financier johann fust to set up a new press, with the printing tools and equipment acting as security. he made sure to employ gutenberg's foreman, peter schoeffer, and several other of his workers, and with this team continued to print, publishing the bible in 1456, and then in august 1457, the first printed book in europe to carry both name of its printer (fust and schoeffer) and the date:-  the magnificent psalter (book of psalms). law.invention.inventor law.inventor.inventions common.topic.webpage common.webpage.topic common.topic.article common.topic.article common.topic.article type.property.expected_type common.image.size type.type.properties
