the evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three strasbourg men - hans riffe, andres heilmann and andres dritzehen - which indicates that by this date gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans. gutenberg changed history with his typeface and printing press. this suggests that by 1438 gutenberg and dritzehen had in all probability already invented a printing process using moveable type (separate pieces of wood or metal for each letter of the alphabet). this work, now known as the gutenberg bible, is regarded as the first major book to come from a printing press. the agreement with riffe and heilmann came to an end in 1443, by which time it is assumed (on the basis of the existence of a scrap of paper with eleven printed lines on each side, dated to 1442, which is the oldest example of european printing from moveable type) that gutenberg had had begun printing. law.invention.inventor law.inventor.inventions common.topic.webpage common.webpage.topic common.topic.article
