to confront this problem, bohr began with the question of atomic spectra. niels bohr and the development of physics bohr began to develop a model of the atom in which electrons were disposed in rings around the nucleus -- a first step towards an explanation of atomic structure. during the 30s, bohr turned to a new, but related, topic: the composition of the atomic nucleus. during the 1920s and 1930s, bohr wrote extensively about atomic structures, proposing two concepts that he considered fundamental to the \"new physics\". chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes chemistry.chemical_element.isotopes
