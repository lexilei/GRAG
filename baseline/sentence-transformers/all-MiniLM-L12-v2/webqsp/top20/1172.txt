an address on the genius and discoveries of sir isaac newton he influenced newton. mathematical works of isaac newton isaac newton also at this time, newton began to think about gravity. he knew newton. newton his new astronomy provided the basis for newton's work. he pioneered the modern method of writing equations,  and anticipated  newton in calculating the powers of numbers. isaac newton sr. newton turned his attention to the nature of light. sir isaac newton's corollaries from his philosophy and chronology his recognition of newton's work and his efforts to take it to completion gave him an important place in the evolution of western thought. in cavendish's last major work (\"the cavendish experiment\") he became the first to measure newton's  gravitational constant, together with the mass and density of the earth. nicolaus copernicus triggered gravity work by isaac newton between 1665 and 1667, newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before leibniz's  discoveries. the optical papers of isaac newton newton's method disque newton his theory was a significant step towards the thoughts of galileo and newton. law.invention.inventor law.invention.inventor astronomy.astronomer.astronomical_objects_discovered law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions law.inventor.inventions astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discovery_site astronomy.telescope_principle_type.telescopic_classifications_of_this_technique kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by kp_lw.philosopher.influenced_by
