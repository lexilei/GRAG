bohr began to develop a model of the atom in which electrons were disposed in rings around the nucleus -- a first step towards an explanation of atomic structure. niels bohr and the development of physics philosophic problems of nuclear science during the 30s, bohr turned to a new, but related, topic: the composition of the atomic nucleus. niels bohr institute for astronomy, geophysics and physics but it was unclear how those particles were arranged within the nucleus, and how the nucleus was shaped. atomic theory and the description of nature : four essays with an introductory survey he helped revolutionize the knowledge of atomic structure by his discovery of the electron (1897). at bohr's lectures pauli began to consider some of the fundamental problems involved in bohr's quantum theory of the atom (such as the existence of various electron energy levels within an atom) and decided that classical physics could not explain why electrons were distributed in various energy levels outside the nucleus, each energy level containing a set number of electrons. quelques développements sur la théorie atomique astronomy.astronomical_observatory.discoveries astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.star_system_body.star_system base.nobelprizes.nobel_subject_area.nobel_awards base.nobelprizes.nobel_subject_area.nobel_awards chemistry.chemical_element.atomic_mass astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discovery_site base.nobelprizes.nobel_prize_winner.nobel_honor base.nobelprizes.nobel_prize_winner.nobel_honor base.nobelprizes.nobel_prize_winner.nobel_honor
