he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. joseph john thomson taught julius robert oppenheimer joseph john thomson taught max born over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \"plum pudding\" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded. joseph james thomson joseph john thomson worked under john william strutt he was succeeded by j. j. thomson as cavendish professor of experimental physics at cambridge in 1884. rutherford became the first research student to work under english physicist j.j. thomson at the cavendish laboratory. with the encouragement of laboratory chief, j.j. thomson, wilson began building an expansion chamber which would enable him to track the paths of atoms and electrons. in 1907 he went to cambridge university to study electrons under british physicist j.j. thomson. chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.type_of_planetographic_feature biology.organism.sex common.topic.subjects common.topic.subjects
