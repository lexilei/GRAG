rutherford became the first research student to work under english physicist j.j. thomson at the cavendish laboratory. thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics, and in 1908 he was knighted for his scientific achievements. joseph john thomson taught max born bohr hoped that the director of the laboratory, english physicist j.j. thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into english. scientist thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons. joseph john thomson taught julius robert oppenheimer in 1895 german physicist roentgendiscovered x-rays, and wilson immediately realized how useful x-rays could be in his studies on clouds. this work was later continued by one of thomson's students, francis aston (developer of the mass spectrograph), and others, and lead to the discovery of many other isotopes, vital to the understanding of the heavy radioactive elements, such as uranium and radium. joseph john thomson taught paul langevin chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student education.education.student
