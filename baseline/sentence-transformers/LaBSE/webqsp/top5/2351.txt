during the early 1660s, hooke made important improvements to the compound microscope and in 1665, he published his great scientific work, 'micrographia' ('small drawings'). boyle described these experiments in 1660, in his first published scientific work, 'new experiments physio-mechanical, touching the spring of the air and its effects'. wallis had kept up his contacts with the men of science around boyle who met regularly in  london or oxford, and when this  group became the royal society in 1662 he was one of the founder members with such as hooke. scientist users included the english physicists  boyle (1669) and  hooke (1680), who constructed his own \"perspective box\" to demonstrate to the royal society the law of vision (it included the novel feature of diaphragms of different sizes to be put over the lens to demonstrate the expansion and contraction of the pupil of the eye). the diary of robert hooke 1672-1680 education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas
