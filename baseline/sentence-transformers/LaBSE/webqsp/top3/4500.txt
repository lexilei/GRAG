it is  probable, but not certain, that gutenberg learned precision metalwork at the mainz mint, where as a youth he would have seen the complex processes involved in producing coinage, which involved the careful and accurate casting and stamping of gold, an understanding of metals and temperature, and a knowledge of the use of casting chambers, dies and presses. gutenberg changed history with his typeface and printing press. gutenberg based his invention on the method then used to mint coins, pouring molten metal into shapes and letting it set into coins called blanks, which were then reheated and punched with a design by a die, the pressure produced by huge screw presses. law.invention.inventor law.inventor.inventions base.argumentmaps.innovator.original_ideas
