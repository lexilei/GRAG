he found that the e/m for the cathode ray \"corpuscles\" (as thomson called them) was constant for any gas used in the experiment (whatever particle it was that made up the cathode rays occurred in all gases and was, therefore, a component of all of the different atoms of which those gases were made), and that this e/m ratio was over 1000 times larger than the ratio for the hydrogen ion, the lightest atom known. joseph john thomson taught julius robert oppenheimer joseph john thomson taught max born chemistry.element_discoverer.discovered astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object astronomy.extraterrestrial_location.on_celestial_object
