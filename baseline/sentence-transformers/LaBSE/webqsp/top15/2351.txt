during the early 1660s, hooke made important improvements to the compound microscope and in 1665, he published his great scientific work, 'micrographia' ('small drawings'). boyle described these experiments in 1660, in his first published scientific work, 'new experiments physio-mechanical, touching the spring of the air and its effects'. wallis had kept up his contacts with the men of science around boyle who met regularly in  london or oxford, and when this  group became the royal society in 1662 he was one of the founder members with such as hooke. scientist users included the english physicists  boyle (1669) and  hooke (1680), who constructed his own \"perspective box\" to demonstrate to the royal society the law of vision (it included the novel feature of diaphragms of different sizes to be put over the lens to demonstrate the expansion and contraction of the pupil of the eye). the diary of robert hooke 1672-1680 in 1658, hooke took on the challenging task of designing an accurate portable clock. with it, boyle (with hooke's assistance) carried out the experiments which resulted in boyle's law, published in 1662. in the first few years of the decade, he published three works showing the results of his studies, 'experiments and considerations touching colors', in 1664, 'new experiments and observations touching cold' in 1665 and 'hydrostatic paradoxes' a year later. from 1654 until 1668, boyle, who set up what became a famous laboratory, took on hooke as his assistant, and mixed with many important intellectuals, including wilkins, wallis, wren, sprat, and the students sydenham and locke. these include boyle's \"sceptical chymist\"(1661), hooke's \"micrographia\" (1665), grew's \"anatomy of plants\" (1681), ray's \"history of plants\" (in three volumes, 1686-1704), and newton's \"principia mathematica\" (1687). the diary of robert hooke, m.a., m.d., f.r.s., 1672-1680, transcribed from the original in the possession of the corporation of the city of london (guildhall library) in his two publications of 1661, 'certain physiological essays' and 'the sceptical chymist', boyle's first aim was to disprove the old theory of the 'four elements': earth, air, fire, and water, as well as the 'three principles': salt, sulphur, and mercury, and to put a mechanical theory of matter in their place. boyle's other objective was to show that the best way to demonstrate the mechanical view was by the use of careful and methodical experimentation, and in 1662 and 1663 he was involved a long argument with the philosopher spinoza on the question of whether experiment would provide proof. philosophical experiments and observations of robert hooke and other eminent virtuoso's in his time (1726) at some point around 1671, he was inspired to take up microscopy, either through having seen a copy of hooke's popular illustrated book 'micrographia' (1665), or  through a desire to improve the glasses used generally by drapers to inspect the quality of cloth. education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.academic.research_areas education.field_of_study.academics_in_this_field education.field_of_study.academics_in_this_field education.field_of_study.academics_in_this_field education.field_of_study.academics_in_this_field education.field_of_study.academics_in_this_field astronomy.astronomical_discovery.discoverer astronomy.astronomical_observatory.discoveries education.academic.advisees owl#inverseOf education.education.institution
